Most websites have an _About_ page where you can learn about the background of the person
or business. They have a _Contact_ page where you can reach out. In contrast, a _Now_ page
is an up-to-date summarized snapshot of where a person is focused on, at this very moment.

### What have I been up to, lately?

_Updated as of March 3, 2025._

Still **rock climbing**! It's been just about 2 years now and I'm able to reliably top 5.10 and most 5.10+ routes. I was able to top one 5.11, but it's still a work in progress!

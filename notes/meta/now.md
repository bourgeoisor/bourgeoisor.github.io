Most websites have an _About_ page where you can learn about the background of the person
or business. They have a _Contact_ page where you can reach out. In contrast, a _Now_ page
is an up-to-date summarized snapshot of where a person is focused on, at this very moment.
The idea for this page was inspired by [Derek Siver's](https://sive.rs/now){:target="_blank"}.

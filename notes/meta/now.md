Most websites have an _About_ page where you can learn about the background of the person
or business. They have a _Contact_ page where you can reach out. In contrast, a _Now_ page
is an up-to-date summarized snapshot of where a person is focused on, at this very moment.

### What have I been up to, lately?

_Updated as of September 27, 2025._

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-location-dot color-red"></i>
Living in **Toronto (ON)** in Canada, as of early July.

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-briefcase color-blue"></i>
Working full-time at **Google** in the **Developer Relations** team in Google Cloud. Nearing my 5th anniversary!

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-plane-departure color-aqua"></i>
Most recent international trip was a 3-weeks vacation in **Japan** I did this past October, with trips to **Salt Lake City (UT)**, **Chicago (IL)**, **Las Vegas (NV)**, **Vancouver (BC)**, **Edmonton (AB)**, **Calgary (AB)**, **New York (NY)**, **Montreal (QC)**, and **Atlanta (GA)** in 2025 so far. For the remainder of the year I have plans for **New York (NY)**, **Boston (MA)**, **Montreal (QC)**, **San Francisco (CA)**, **Seattle (WA)**, and **Vancouver (BC)**.

Still working on my side project **[XIV ToDo](https://xivtodo.com){:target="_blank"}** regularly, and finally
having some time to finish up my **[personal website revamp](/hello-world/)** (you're currently looking at it!) I'm also working on-and-off on a spec-compliant IRC client.

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-person-hiking color-orange"></i>
Still **rock climbing**! It's been just about 2 years now and I'm able to reliably top most 5.10x routes. I was able to top one or two 5.11x route, but that's still a work in progress. Although I've been more sporadic about it since moving to Toronto.

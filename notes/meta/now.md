Most websites have an _About_ page where you can learn about the background of the person
or business. They have a _Contact_ page where you can reach out. In contrast, a _Now_ page
is an up-to-date summarized snapshot of where a person is focused on, at this very moment.

### What have I been up to, lately?

_Updated as of December 2, 2025._

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-location-dot color-red"></i>
Living in **Toronto (ON)** in Canada, as of early July.

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-briefcase color-blue"></i>
Working full-time at **Google** in the **Developer Relations** team in Google Cloud. Just passed my 5th anniversary!

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-plane-departure color-aqua"></i>
Spent the past few months more on the road than at home. For the most part, work opportunities brought me to the 4 corners of North America, covering 11 cities in 11 provinces and states.

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-seedling color-green"></i>
Not working quite as much on **[XIV ToDo](https://xivtodo.com){:target="_blank"}**. I hope to find more time soon to get back at it. I've also been working on-and-off on a spec-compliant IRC client that I hope to "finish" by the end of the year.

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-person-hiking color-orange"></i>
Still **rock climbing**! It's been over 2 years now and I'm able to reliably top virtually all 5.10x routes. I was able to top one or two 5.11x route, but that's still a work in progress. Although I've been more sporadic about it since moving to Toronto.

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-hat-santa color-red"></i>
The **winter holidays** are near, and though I typically spend that time visiting my family, this year I'll be spending two weeks at the comfort of my home, relaxing and working on side projects.

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-chalkboard-user color-aqua"></i>
Picked up **learning Japanese** again, after a long hiatus. I'm taking the JLPT N4 in mid-December.

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-book color-purple"></i>
Currently **reading**...

- The Murderbot Diaries

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-game-console-handheld color-orange"></i>

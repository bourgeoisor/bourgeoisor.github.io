title: My stance on AI
---

## <i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-microchip-ai me-1"></i>My stance on AI

In an era of commodified artificial intelligence, I want to be fully transparent on how I feel about AI and where AI has been used (or not) within my projects. See something that I forgot, or that you disagree with? I would love to [hear your thoughts](/contact/).

## Conversations

In general, I think using AI tools as a substitute for what would otherwise be a search engine query is okay, and I do use [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app){:target="_blank"} that way. I take the same precautions as for search engine queries (e.g. is the output verifiable by a source of authority?)

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-thumbs-up color-green"></i>
<b>Yes</b>: Using AI to brainstorm ideas

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-thumbs-up color-green"></i>
<b>Yes</b>: Using AI to ask questions and learn

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-thumbs-up color-green"></i>
<b>Yes</b>: Using AI to help link thoughts together

## Code generation

I have [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot){:target="_blank"} set-up in my coding editor and use it primarily like I would [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/){:target="_blank"} (e.g. "how do you iterate over a dictionary, again?") I keep my usage sparse and never use code that I do not understand or that breaks consistency.

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-thumbs-up color-green"></i>
<b>Yes</b>: Using AI to code-complete lines.

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-thumbs-up color-green"></i>
<b>Yes</b>: Using AI to generate small functions (< 10 lines).

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-thumbs-up color-green"></i>
<b>Yes</b>: Using AI to auto-complete boiler-plate or repetitive code.

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-thumbs-down color-red"></i>
<b>No</b>: Using AI to generate code I do not understand.

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-thumbs-down color-red"></i>
<b>No</b>: Using AI to generate large chunks of code (> 10 lines).

## Content creation

I have never published content generated by an AI, and do not intend on ever doing so. Beyond the variety of societal impact it causes<sup>[1]</sup>, I truly believe that no one should be bothered to appreciate something no one could be bothered to create.

To me, art is deeply personal and is one of the few sacred wonders and joys of the human experience. If we outsource its creation to computers... What do we even have left?

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-thumbs-up color-green"></i>
<b>Yes</b>: Using AI to critique work and ask for feedback.

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-thumbs-up color-green"></i>
<b>Yes</b>: Using AI to validate consistency of written content.

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-thumbs-down color-red"></i>
<b>No</b>: Using AI to generate written content (blog posts, emails, etc.)

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-thumbs-down color-red"></i>
<b>No</b>: Using AI to generate visual arts (photos, paintings, drawings, etc.)

## Training AI using copyrighted material

Under no circumstances do I condone the training of AI models using copyrighted material without proper authorization from their respective creators. I find it disgraceful, and I oppose using AI models that have been found to engage in doing so.

<i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-thumbs-down color-red"></i>
<b>No</b>: Using AI trained on copyrighted material.

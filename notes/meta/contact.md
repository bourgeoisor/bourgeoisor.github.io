## <i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-envelope me-1"></i>Contact

Do you want to chat about something I've talked about, share a new opportunity with me,
or simply would like to say hi? I would love to hear from you! Read more [about my communication style](/communication-style).

The fastest way to reach me is via email at `bourgeoisor [symbol] gmail.com`.

### Socials

You can follow me or DM me through one of my social accounts:

<span class="me-2 no-wrap"><i class="fa-brands fa-github me-1"></i>[GitHub](https://github.com/bourgeoisor){:target="_blank"}</span>
<span class="me-2 no-wrap"><i class="fa-brands fa-instagram me-1"></i>[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/olivi_eh/){:target="_blank"}</span>
<span class="me-2 no-wrap"><i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin me-1"></i>[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivi-eh/){:target="_blank"}</span>
<span class="me-2 no-wrap"><i class="fa-brands fa-bluesky me-1"></i>[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/olivi-eh.dev){:target="_blank"}</span>

I am not generally active on any other social media platforms. If in doubt, it's probably not me.

### Blogs

In addition to [this site's blog](/blog/), I also sometimes publish articles at the following places:

<span class="me-2 no-wrap"><i class="fa-brands fa-medium me-1"></i>[Medium](https://medium.com/@bourgeoisor){:target="_blank"}</span>
<span class="me-2 no-wrap"><i class="fa-brands fa-dev me-1"></i>[DEV](https://dev.to/bourgeoisor){:target="_blank"}</span>

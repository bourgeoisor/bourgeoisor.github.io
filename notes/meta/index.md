## <i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-messages-question me-1"></i>Who am I?

Hi!<i class="fa-regular fa-hand-wave ms-1"></i> My name's Olivier (`/É”.li.vje/`).
I'm a Canadian software developer with a decade of experience.
Outside of tech, I enjoy being in nature, taking [photographs](https://www.instagram.com/olivi_eh/){:target="_blank"},
listening to & playing music, exploring urbanism, and learning how the world around me works.
You can find out [more about me](/about/), or take a look at [my resume](/resume/) and [projects](/projects/).

Hi! My name's Olivier (`/É”.li.vje/`). I'm a Canadian software developer with a decade of experience. Outside of tech, I enjoy being in nature, taking [photographs](https://www.instagram.com/olivi_eh/){:target="_blank"}, listening to & playing music, exploring urbanism, and learning how the world around me works. You can find out [more about me](/about/), or take a look at [my resume](/resume/) and [projects](/projects/).

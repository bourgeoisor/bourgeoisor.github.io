### Bienvenue chez moi!

Hello!

### Why build a personal website?

(why: miss web 1.0 and individuality, don't want to be constrained by big tech apps, want to have a "living biograph" of my thoughts, show screenshots)

### How can you get started?

blah

(in next part, I go over..)

### Appendix: Evolution over the years

In 2015, my personal website looked like this:

Then in 2016, I completely revamped it for a lighter, cleaner version:

Still in the same style, in 2021 I did another pass of polish:

Finally in 2024, I once again revamped it from scratch to get what you're looking at today:

Let's see what the future holds!

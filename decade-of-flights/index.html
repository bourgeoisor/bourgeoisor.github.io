    <h2>Decade of flights: Visualisation from ten years of data</h2>
    <p>I took my first flight on June 1, 2015 at the age of 20<sup>*</sup>. Now well into June 2025, I wanted to look back on the past 10 years and see what kind of statistics I could get out of it. Please make sure your seat and tray table are in the upright position for take-off!</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of my Obsidian vault opened on the graph view" src="/static/images/decade-of-flights/cessna-140.jpg" />
<span class="img-caption">Photo I took mid-flight aboard a Cessna 140.</span></p>
<p><span class="text-small"><sup>*</sup>Well okay&hellip; That&rsquo;s not exactly true. In late-2012 I stepped aboard an old Cessna 140 held together by duct tape and fairy dust about an hour north of Quebec City, and in the summer of 2014 I hung out in the back of a Cessna 182 and climbed up 10,000 feet before jumping out of it. But my first commercial flight was in 2015 so let&rsquo;s run with that.</span></p>
<h3>Historical flight data</h3>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned in <a href="/obsidian">my blog post about Obsidian</a>, I take note of a lot of things. This includes flights that I&rsquo;ve taken. I had on hand a complete list of flights that I&rsquo;ve taken in the past, but I realized that it only contained flight numbers and dates, and nothing else. Surely the rest of the data should be available online somewhere, right?</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take me long to realize that historical flight data was extremely difficult to get a hold of. Despite looking for quite some time, I wasn&rsquo;t able to find flight data older than 3 days that wasn&rsquo;t locked behind some membership-only service or a paid subscription. I ended up shelling out $25 to get access to the simple data I was looking for (departure and arrival times &ndash; expected and actual &ndash; and aircraft).</p>
<p>From there, I built a short Python script to intake my flight data and output stats and graphs. Full disclosure, I am not a stats or data vis person, but I did my best!</p>
<h3>Preliminary results</h3>
<p>Using the aforementioned script, I computed a handful of interesting statistics out of the 76 flights I&rsquo;ve taken over the past decade. Here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total number of flights:</strong> 76</li>
<li><strong>Unique cities visited:</strong> 32</li>
<li><strong>Unique airports visited:</strong> 35</li>
<li><strong>Unique airlines flown:</strong> 11</li>
<li><strong>Total distance flown:</strong> 15,6240 km</li>
<li><strong>Total duration flown:</strong> 244 hours and 15 minutes</li>
<li><strong>Mean duration per flight:</strong> 3 hours and 12 minutes</li>
<li><strong>Mean distance per flight:</strong> 2,055 km</li>
<li><strong>Shortest distance:</strong> 165 km</li>
<li><strong>Longest distance:</strong> 10,370 km</li>
<li><strong>Shortest duration:</strong> 44 minutes</li>
<li><strong>Longest duration:</strong> 13 hours and 38 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>Who knew that I would&rsquo;ve spent just shy of 250 hours over the past decade stuck in airplanes! I don&rsquo;t think I want to know how many hours I&rsquo;ve spent in the airports waiting for said flights, though.</p>
<h3>When do I travel?</h3>
<p>Immediately, the first thing that comes to mind in the following chart is that the global pandemic of 2020 really put a pause in my own travels. I did not fly at all in either 2020 or 2021, and only by necessity during 2022 and 2023. In fact, I&rsquo;m still not up to par with the amount of flying I used to do pre-2020.</p>
<p><img alt="Chart showcasing the # of flights per year" src="/static/images/decade-of-flights/flights_per_year.png" />
<span class="img-caption">Chart showcasing the # of flights per year.</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also fairly noticeable that I don&rsquo;t travel during the winter, in general. Most of my trips end up in the shoulder seasons (either May-June, or September-October).</p>
<p><img alt="Chart showcasing the # of flights per month" src="/static/images/decade-of-flights/flights_per_month.png" />
<span class="img-caption">Chart showcasing the # of flights per month.</span></p>
<h3>Where do I travel?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived most of my life on the east coast of Canada, which is a fairly sparsely populated area. This means that most of my flights had connections through Toronto or Montreal. It also means that a lot of these flights started or ended in Moncton, which was the city near where I grew up.</p>
<p><img alt="Chart showcasing the # of flights per city" src="/static/images/decade-of-flights/flights_per_city.png" />
<span class="img-caption">Chart showcasing the # of flights per city.</span></p>
<p>Consequently, the airports I&rsquo;ve been in the most are also all Canadians (many of which have inflated numbers due to connections).</p>

<span class="img-caption">Chart showcasing the # of flights per airport.</span></p>
<h3>Through which means do I travel?</h3>
<p>This first chart is interesting. I thought for sure that the top aircraft used in my past flights would be a Boeing or an Airbus but hey, we do love that Bombardier representation!</p>
<p><img alt="Chart showcasing the # of flights per aircraft" src="/static/images/decade-of-flights/flights_per_aircraft.png" />
<span class="img-caption">Chart showcasing the # of flights per aircraft.</span></p>
<p>And&hellip; Yeah I&rsquo;m mostly an Air Canada guy. They often offer the best availability or prices for the locations I&rsquo;m interested in, so most of my flights end up through them.</p>

<h3>What do the flights look like?</h3>
<p>Lastly, I was also interested in seeing how flights themselves looked like, in a bit more detail (departures, arrivals, duration, delays).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an early bird, so I tend to prefer flights that depart after 9 or 10 in the morning, and that is clearly visible on the following chart, with the bulk of my flights departing between 11am and 3pm.</p>
<p><img alt="Chart showcasing the # of flights per departure hour" src="/static/images/decade-of-flights/flights_per_departure_hour.png" />
<span class="img-caption">Chart showcasing the # of flights per departure hour.</span></p>
<p>As for arrival, the chart looks a bit more like a bell curve, peaking at 2pm, tapering off on both sides.</p>
<p><img alt="Chart showcasing the # of flights per arrival hour" src="/static/images/decade-of-flights/flights_per_arrival_hour.png" />
<span class="img-caption">Chart showcasing the # of flights per arrival hour.</span></p>
<p>Immediately, it&rsquo;s obvious that the majority of the flights I&rsquo;ve taken are short-haul (with most being less than 3 hours long). The few exceptions at the tail-end are going to Europe pre-pandemic, or to Japan last year.</p>
<p><img alt="Chart showcasing the # of flights per duration" src="/static/images/decade-of-flights/flights_per_duration.png" />
<span class="img-caption">Chart showcasing the # of flights per duration.</span></p>
<p>Delays was an interesting metric to chart, because naively I think of myself as fairly unlucky when it comes to flying. It feels like most of my flights are delayed. But now that I have this chart in front of me, it&rsquo;s undeniable that almost half of the flights I&rsquo;ve taken in fact arrived earlier than expected. Of the delays, almost all were less than an hour.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Chart showcasing the # of flights per arrival delta.</span></p>
<h3>Future improvements</h3>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for now, but I&rsquo;m thinking of perhaps doing another one of these every 5 years or so. There are a number of improvements I&rsquo;d like to look at for next time, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better or nicer looking charts.</li>
<li>Color-coding in the charts.</li>
<li>Stats on how long I stay in airports.</li>
<li>Break down the &ldquo;per year&rdquo; chart to visualise e.g. flights per continent.</li>
<li>Add some scatterplots (e.g. distance vs. duration, distance vs. delays).</li>
<li>See how day of the week or time departed correlates to delays.</li>
<li>Differentiate reasons for flights (e.g. vacation, work).</li>
<li>Add additional charts (e.g. flights per day of the week).</li>
<li>Add heatmap or flight paths overlaid on a world map.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of anything else I could track? Interested in chatting about this in more depth? <a href="/contact">Let me know!</a></p>
